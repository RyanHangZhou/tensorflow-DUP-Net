Introduction

This work is published on ICCV, 2019. 

Neural networks are vulnerable to adversarial examples, which poses a threat to their application in security sensitive systems. We propose a Denoiser and UPsampler Network (DUP-Net) structure as defenses for 3D adversarial point cloud classification, where the two modules reconstruct surface smoothness by dropping or adding points. In this paper, statistical outlier removal (SOR) and a data-driven upsampling network are considered as denoiser and upsampler respectively. Compared with baseline defenses, DUP-Net has three advantages. First, with DUP-Net as a defense, the target model is more robust to white-box adversarial attacks. Second, the statistical outlier removal provides added robustness since it is a non-differentiable denoising operation. Third, the upsampler network can be trained on a small dataset and defends well against adversarial attacks generated from other point cloud datasets. We conduct various experiments to validate that DUP-Net is very effective as defense in practice. Our best defense eliminates 83.8% of C&W and l2 loss based attack (point shifting), 50.0% of C&W and Hausdorff distance loss based attack (point adding) and 9.0% of saliency map based attack (point dropping) under 200 dropped points on PointNet.

Installation
--
Install TensorFlow. The code has been tested with Python 3.6, TensorFlow 1.12.0, CUDA 9.0 and cuDNN 7 on Ubuntu 16.04.

Usage
--
Compile sh files in directory "tf_ops/" before usage.

To process a point cloud by DUP-Net:

    # Statistical outlier removal (SOR)
    python filter.py --removal 'sor' \
                     --batch_size 4 \
                     --test_path 'data/lsgan_bro1_nogan2' \
                     --filtered_dir 'data/modelnet40_filtered/filtered_test'
    
    # DUP-Net
    python upsample.py --num_point 2048 \
                       --up_ratio 2 \
                       --test_path 'data/modelnet40_filtered' \
                       --upsampled_dir 'data/modelnet40_upsampled/upsampled_test'

 To classify the processed point cloud:
 
    python evaluate_filtered_targeted_adv.py --num_classes 40 \
                                             --model_path 'log/modelnet40_pointnet/model.ckpt' \
                                             --test_path 'data/modelnet40_upsampled'
